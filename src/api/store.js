With help from Captain Obvious and over 20,000 last-minute deals, you will be sure to find the Obvious Choice for your accommodation. Millions of hotel reviews, a 24-hour call center and no added fees for canceling help put your mind at ease when you're searching for the best hotel for you. Use a Hotels.com coupon code below to save even more off your luxury hotel room or suite.",

        companycoupons: "You can often save at Hotels.com using a coupon or promo code. Most coupons apply to select bookings or destinations, but sitewide discounts are occasionally available. However, most Hotels.com sales don't use a coupon code, including its last-minute getaway deals. Your best bet is to sign up for One Key rewards, which provides members access to exclusive offers and a discount of at least 10% off on participating hotels, airlines, rentals, and more.",

        rewards: "One Key is Hotels.com's free loyalty rewards program, which you can also use at Expedia and Vrbo. This rewards program lets you earn and redeem rewards for travel across all three sites. Unlike Hotels.com's former free nights promotion under its prior rewards program, One Key lets you earn rewards faster and save sooner. Plus, the more you travel, you'll gain access to higher-tier member rewards and offers.",

        priceguarantee: "We know you're worried about booking at just the right time to nab the best price. You don't have to worry about getting caught in a bad deal since Hotels.com offers a price guarantee. If you see a lower price on Hotels.com for your trip before your check-in date, you can get a refund for the difference. If you're booking is non-refundable, the difference will be credited as OneKeyCash, which can be used on future travel. Price matches to competitors are also available as part of the guarantee and are issued in OneKeyCash.",

        cancelations_refunds: "You never know when your travel plans may need to change, but you can easily change or cancel your trip as you need from your Hotels.com account. Most hotels and rentals can be refunded if you cancel in advance, but we recommend looking for hotels and services marked with Free Cancelation when booking to keep your travel plans safe. Refund eligibility is at the discretion of the hotel, airline or other travel partner you booked with. Most that don't offer a refund provide a travel credit instead, which you can use on a future trip.",

        customer_support: "If you need help with your travel plans, Hotels.com has a 24/7 Virtual Agent that provides several services through online chat. However, you can also ask to be connected to a live representative or call Hotels.com at (866) 223-2092.",

                answer: "Hotels.com partners with hundreds of thousands of hotels that offer free cancellation options, but policies may vary from property to property. To find listings with free cancellation, filter your search by the 'free cancellation' option and be sure to double-check the property's policy."

                question: "How does the Hotels.com price guarantee work?",
                answer: "The Hotels.com price guarantee promises to match lower rates listed publicly by their competitors or on Hotels.com. To be eligible for a price match, the listing must be for the same accommodation option at the same property on the same dates. If you find a better rate after you booked via Hotels.com, you can submit a price match request. If your price match is approved and your booking is refundable, Hotels.com will refund you the difference immediately. If your booking is non-refundable, the site will refund you the price difference in the form of a Hotels.com coupon for a future stay."

You can also download our browser extension, Deal Finder, to have coupon codes applied automatically when you check out at Hotels.com and your other favorite companies.",

                question: "What is One Key and what changed for Hotels.com Rewards?",
                answer: "One Key unifies Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo loyalty rewards. It's free to join and streamlines travel rewards, offering flexibility, peace of mind, and personalized access. Members can earn and redeem rewards, access Member Prices, and enjoy tier-based travel perks.",
                answer2: "One Key also replaces the former Hotels.com's Rewards program. It allows you to earn and use OneKeyCash across a broader selection of travel services on Hotels.com, Expedia, and Vrbo, along with exclusive discounts and benefits. You can now redeem rewards without waiting for 10 nights and have the flexibility to use them at your convenience, including for flights and car rentals. Additionally, achieving tier status is now easier with lower qualification thresholds and more travel counting toward progression. For example, Silver status can be attained with a weekend stay and roundtrip flights.",
                answer3: "If you had a Hotels.com Rewards account, your confirmed reward stamps and nights from bookings were automatically converted to OneKeyCash. Some exclusions apply, such as if you have a rewards account that wasn't created on the Hotels.com U.S. site or if you have pending travel booked on a non-U.S. site. Reach out to the Hotels.com customer support team for more information. Additionally, if you had a Hotels.com Rewards account, it was automatically converted to a One Key account.",
                answer4: "If you still have a Hotels.com credit card, you can still use your Hotels.com credit card with One Key, keeping the same rewards value and redeeming them on Hotels.com, Expedia, and Vrbo. You'll earn $11 OneKeyCash for every $500 spent, with no need to wait for 10 stamps to redeem. Unused introductory reward nights will convert to OneKeyCash. Your membership level aligns with program rules, and Silver status is retained if you earned it via the credit card.",

You can locate the cashback offer card on the right and, once the offer is activated, you’ll be directed to the store's site to make your purchase. Additionally, you can even use a promo code for more savings.",
                answer2: "Once your purchase at Hotels.com is approved, RetailMeNot will email you that your cashback reward can be redeemed from your RetailMeNot account via PayPal or Venmo. Cashback rewards through RetailMeNot generally include sitewide purchases, but it's best to review the offer card to see if there are any special exceptions or exclusions."
